# IT140--Python-Story-Board-Game
This project was developed as the final assignment for IT 140 – Introduction to Python Programming at Southern New Hampshire University. The goal was to apply foundational Python skills by designing a functional, interactive text-based game.

The result is a Mario-themed adventure game where the player explores a castle, collects six key items, and attempts to rescue Princess Peach by defeating Bowser. The game logic was implemented using Python dictionaries, loops, conditionals, and user input handling, with a focus on clean structure and readability.

Creating this game allowed me to reinforce core programming concepts such as control flow, data structures, and function-based design. It also gave me the opportunity to incorporate creative storytelling into a fully playable Python program.

I’m proud of what I accomplished in this project and look forward to building on these skills in future software development work.
